# Basic-Unity3D-Python-server
A stripped-down version of tawnkramer/sdsandbox (https://github.com/tawnkramer/sdsandbox/tree/master) to create a simple Python server - Unity3D connection to send and receive messages.

Hopefully I can change this into a plugin for Unity3D and a modulair Python script with which it's easy to send your own data. In that way it can be easily added to existing projects.

This README will be updated when it is finally working.
